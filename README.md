# Build Instructions

This website uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator, which is written in Ruby. To build this website, perform the following steps

1. Ensure that **Ruby 3** is installed ([Instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation)). 

    *Note for MacOS users:* We recommend that you do not modify the system-installed Ruby version, which may break scripts required by the OS. Instead install a copy of Ruby via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [Macports](https://www.macports.org/).

2. Ensure that you have the latest bundler version installed. On MacOS/Linux this can be done by typing:
```
gem install bundler
```
You may need to run as root using `sudo` at this step, depending on your setup. 

3. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and other packages needed to build this website by invoking:
```
bundler config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
cd /path/to/../AMLab-Amsterdam.github.io
bundler install
```
This will install all required packages into the subdirectory `vendor/bundle` of your working directory.

4. You should now be able to view the website by executing the following command:
```
bundler exec jekyll serve
```
This will start a webserver that allows you to view the website by accessing `http://127.0.0.1:4000` in your browser.

# Adding Your Personal Information 

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:AMLab-Amsterdam/AMLab-Amsterdam.github.io.git
```
2. Checkout a new branch with the following name:
- ```FirstnameLastnameNew``` if you are creating your personal page
- ```FirstnameLastnameUpdate``` if you are updating your existing personal page

3. Add the following files (details below):
- A description file ```./_people/FirstnameLastname.md```
- A profile picture ```./assets/img/FirstnameLastname.[jpg/png]```
- Optimally, a bibliography file ```./_bibliography/FirstnameLastname.bib```

4. Commit and push your changes to your newly created branch.

5. Open a pull-request on Github.
